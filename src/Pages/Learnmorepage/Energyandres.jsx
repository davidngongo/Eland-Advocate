              The Great Oil & Gas Paradigm Shift <br /> What Does It Mean?
              <br />
              “East Africa used to be regarded as an oil industry backwater,
              <br /> a poorer relative to the continent’s resource- rich north
              and west,” the Financial Times observed.

            <p className="text-xl text-black ">
              This has quickly changed in the past few years. Now East Africa
              has been dubbed the next Oil frontier and we at Eland Advocates
              are helping our clients keep abreast with the shift in paradigm in
              the region’s Oil & Gas industry.
