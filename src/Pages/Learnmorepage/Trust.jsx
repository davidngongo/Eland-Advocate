              The Eland Advocates team combines a strong and broadly based
              commercial trusts practice with equally expert trusts, estate

              The team often works on matters originating from the firm’s
              pre-eminent corporate department, usually where a trust is part of
              the structure of a transaction or undertaking or a body of
              trustees is party to the transaction.

              Individuals seek Eland Advocates’ expertise when setting up trusts
              and making wills or gifts. Trustees rely on the firm’s advice on
              making distributions and changing the terms of their trust.
              Charities consult the team if they want to alter their
              constitution or are unsure whether they can make a particular type
              of grant.
