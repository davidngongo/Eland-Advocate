              Legal representation of the manufacturing industry requires
              innovation, agility, insight, and pervasiveness – all hinging on

              Clients in the manufacturing industry grapple with a myriad of
              business and legal issues on a daily basis, including brand
              protection, technical, design and intellectual property rights,
              product life cycles, warranties, research and development and
              revenue streams from maintenance.

              In a difficult economic climate, close consideration also has to

              required in a number of areas including complex dispute
              resolution, elaborate corporate restructuring, health and safety
              and environment, procurement and contracting and regulatory
              issues.
