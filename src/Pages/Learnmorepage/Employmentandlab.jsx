              Eland Advocates is a clear leader in employment and labour law
              matters having consistently and successfully advised some of the

              The integration of the East African labour market presents many
              complex structural and frictional constraints that call for
              harmonization of Labour policies, laws and pro- grammes. East
              Africa is quickly catching up with the rest of Africa and the
              world at large, and the manner in which human resources operate is
              becoming increasingly complicated in its rapidly changing legal
              environment.
